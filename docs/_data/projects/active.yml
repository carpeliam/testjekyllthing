    In the Prome Conference Room, 4th Floor CIC.
    Tonight is the third of five Legal Hack Nights dedicated to building out a reference implementation blockchain-backed individual identity digital signature app.  The app is intended to be a working prototype we can use to evaluate and work with individual identity innovation and to better understand how legal, technical and other requirements can be addressed in an integrated manner.  
    Massachusetts Legal Hackers is grateful to hack along with Code for Boston during this special 5-part series!

    Urban Planning with Virtual Reality: Inman Square Intersection

    We're looking to create a moderately realistic model of the Inman Square intersection redesign as a way to communicate the City's plans and progress to the public. We'll also be testing how VR affects public opinion on a contentious planning issue.

    Need skills:

    - Sketchup or 3D modeling software in general
    - Unity or AFrame
    - Research / survey design

    No VR experience required.
